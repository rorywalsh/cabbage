; A synthesiser utilising the oscbnk opcode
; 
; CONTROLS
; --------
; 
; -Oscillators-
; Amp        --    output amplitude of the oscillators sections
; N.Oscs     --    number of oscillators
; Spread     --    pitch spread
;; SPREAD ENVELOPE
;; Amt.       --    amount of influence of the envelope
;; Att.       --    attack time of the envelope
;; Dec.       --    decay time of the envelope
;; Sus.       --    sustain time of the envelope
;; Rel.       --    release time of the envelope
; Speed      --    speed of pitch modulations
; Waveform   --    (dropdown menu) wavefrom used by the oscillator.
; mono       --    activate monophonic mode
; Time       --    portamento time (monophonic mode)
; T.Shift    --    wavetable shift (will alter the tone if a multi-waveform wavetable instrument is chosen)
; P.Bend     --    pitch bend. The is a GUI alternative to use if you don't have hardware pitch bend.
; Bend Rng.  --    pitch bend range
; -Random Seed-
; Mode for setting random seed for random number generators in oscbnk:
; Clock M.   --    seeded from the system clock therefore each note (even if the same note is played) 
;            will produced the same 'random' values. Left and right channels use the same value.
; Clock St.  --    same as the above except that left and right channels will use different values.
; Note M.    --    seeded by the note played therefore repeating a note will produce the same 'random' values.
;            (Left and right channels use the same seed.) 
; Note St.   --    Same as the above except that left and right channels will use different values.
; Fixed    M. --    All notes use a fixed seed all of the time. Left and right channels use different fixed values.
; Fixed    St.--    Same as the above except that left and right channels will use different values.
;  N.B. You can most clearly hear the effects of different settings by setting 'Spread' to a large value and 
;    by setting speed to zero.

; -Filter-
; two filters are available: tonex and diodeladder (Res=0, tonex is used; Res>0, diodeladder is used)
; Manual     --    manual control of the filter cutoff
; Env.       --    amount of influence of the envelope on top of the Manual control
; Att.       --    attack time of the envelope
; Dec.       --    decay time of the envelope
; Sus.       --    sustain time of the envelope
; Rel.       --    release time of the envelope
; Layers     --    number of iterations of the filter and therefore controlling the cutoff slope steepness (tonex only)
; Res.       --    resonance of the diodeladder filter. When this is zero, tonex is used.

; -Filter LFO-
; shape       --    (drop down menu) LFO shape
; Rate        --    LFO rate
; Depth       --    LFO depth / amplitude
; Delay       --    delay time before LFO has any effect
; Rise        --    time it take for LFO amplitude to rise from zero to 'Depth'

; -Amplitude Envelope-
; Att        --    envelope attack time  
; Dec        --    envelope decay time   
; Sus        --    envelope sustain level
; Rel        --    envelope release time 
; 
; -Reverb-
; Mix         --    dry/wet mix
; Size        --    room size

; -Exciter- Adds brightness to the sound via waveshaping
; Amount      --    amount of signal outputted by the exciter
; Freq.       --    frequency above which the exciter has influence
