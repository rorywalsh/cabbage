**popup(val)** This identifier, used with an image or groupbox will convert the plant into a popup plant. The plant will not be shown on the instrument's main interface, but will instead appear when the user sets `visible` to 1.
< DAWs treat popup dialogue windows in different ways. As a result, you may notice inconsistent behaviour when running your instruments as plugins across a variety of different hosts.
