_____________________________
**opcodeDir(dir)** This will override the OPCODE6DIR64 directory. `dir` should be a directory. It's always best to use relative rather than absolute directories. The only time you every really need to use this is when you are distributing plugin that use some of Csound's plugin opcodes, in which case you will need to tell Csound where to find these plugins.
