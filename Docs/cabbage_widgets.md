Cabbage widgets can loosly be split into two groups, interactive widgets and non-interactive widgets. Each interactive widget, such as a slider, a button, etc., will be accessible in a plugin host. The non-interactive widgets, such as group boxes and images, can only be controlled manually, or via Csound. Software channels are used in order for Cabbage to communicate with Csound, and vice versa. The name that appears beside each native slider in the plugin host will be the assigned channel name for that widget. 

Each Cabbage widget has a corresponding set of identifiers that can be set to control its appearance and behaviour. Not all widgets support the same identifiers. For example, a groupbox will never need to have a channel assigned to it because it is a static control. Likewise, buttons don't need to use the range() identifier because they are only ever on or off, 0 or 1. Parameters presented in the following reference manual within quotation marks represent string values, while those without represent floating point decimals or integer values. Please use the menu on the left to navigate through the various types of widget's supported be Cabbage.

>bounds() must be set for every widget. All other identifiers will be given default values if none are set.
